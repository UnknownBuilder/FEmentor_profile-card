## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

I familiarized myself with the box model (padding, margin, borders, etc.) as well as image and element positining. 

I also started to understand a bit better why people might use things like SaSS, frameworks, and libraries to do their CSS. I couldn't believe just how much code I wrote for something so basic. I'm terrified to think what a complex app would look like with pure CSS. 

### Continued development

- When doing this challenge I started to think that there has to be an easier way to do the CSS. I couldn't believe how much code was needed to get such a simple result. 

I suppose, this is why frameworks like Boostrap and Tailwind CSS exist. I'll look into these and other technologies to see what benefits I can extract from them. 

However, I'll continue to use pure CSS until I'm sick of it as I want learn the fundamentals of the technologies that power the web. Wouldn't want to end up a ![frameworker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UowtlZB2a70&t=532s&ab_channel=ThePrimeTime) . ðŸ˜…
